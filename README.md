Greenden – Modern Plant Store Website (Tailwind CSS Project)
Greenden is a fully responsive and visually appealing plant store website created using HTML and Tailwind CSS. The project focuses on delivering a clean, minimalistic, and nature-inspired design that showcases plants and gardening products in an elegant layout. It is designed to resemble a modern e-commerce homepage, highlighting Tailwind’s utility-first approach to building fast, flexible, and scalable interfaces.
Key Features


Clean and Modern UI:
The design follows a fresh green color palette inspired by nature, giving the website a calm and eco-friendly feel. Tailwind’s utility classes help maintain consistency across sections.


Responsive Layout:
All sections—hero, features, product cards, and footer—are fully responsive. The website adjusts smoothly across devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones without writing custom CSS.


Hero Section:
Includes a bold heading, a short description, and a call-to-action button encouraging users to explore products. A plant-themed image reinforces the brand identity.


Product Showcase:
Displays popular or featured plant items using neatly designed product cards with images, names, prices, and hover effects that enhance user interaction.


Reusable Components:
The project uses Tailwind CSS utility classes to build reusable UI components, reducing repetitive code and improving maintainability.


Fast Development Workflow:
Tailwind CSS made it easy to customize spacing, colors, fonts, and responsiveness directly in the HTML, speeding up the development process.
